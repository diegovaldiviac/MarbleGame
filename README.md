# marbleGame

-----------------------

In this assignment, we were asked to implement a model-view-controller design of the marble board game with multi-move functionalities in Java, using an object-oriented approach with extensive testing and strict coding style formats. This implementation accepts input via the jdk console and runs an asynchronous game (meaning that the console stalls to wait for input) of marbe game.
